# Capstone-Task-II

The goal of this task is to create a game using pygame, using basic images for three "enemies" and one player, with one prize.
The player should be able to move left, right, up and down. If the player collides with one of the enemies the game should exit, and output a message saying "You lose."
if the player collides with the prize image, the game should quit and output a message saying "You win".
